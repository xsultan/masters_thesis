Technical debt refers to incomplete or temporary workarounds that allow us to speed up software development in the short term at the cost of paying a higher price later on. Recently, studies have shown that technical debt can be detected from source code comments, referred to as "self-admitted technical debt." Researchers have examined the detection, classification and removal of self-admitted technical debt. However, to date, no empirical evidence has been compiled to assess the impact of self-admitted technical debt on software quality.

Therefore, in this thesis, we examine the hypothetical trade-off between self-admitted technical debt and software quality by investigating whether (i) files with self-admitted technical debt have more defects compared to files without self-admitted technical debt, (ii) whether accumulation of self-admitted technical debt incurs future defects, and (iii) whether self-admitted technical debt-related changes tend to be more difficult. We quantify the difficulty of a change using well-known measures proposed in prior work, such as the amount of churn, the number of files, the number of modified modules in a change, as well as the entropy of a change. An empirical study using five open source projects, namely Hadoop, Chromium, Cassandra, Spark and Tomcat, showed that: i) there is no clear trend when it comes to defects and self-admitted technical debt, although the defectiveness of the technical debt files increases after the introduction of technical debt, ii) self-admitted technical debt-related changes induce less future defects than non-technical debt-related changes, however, iii) self-admitted technical debt changes are more difficult to perform, i.e., they are more complex. Our study indicates that although technical debt may have negative effects, its impact is not limited to defects, but rather extends to making the system more difficult to change in the future.
